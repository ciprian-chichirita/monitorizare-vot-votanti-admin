Monitorizare Vot is a mobile app for monitoring elections by authorized observers. They can use the app in order to offer a real-time snapshot on what is going on at polling stations and they can report on any noticeable irregularities. 

The NGO-s with authorized observers for monitoring elections have real time access to the data the observers are transmitting therefore they can report on how voting is evolving and they can quickly signal to the authorities where issues need to be solved. 

Moreover, where it is allowed, observers can also photograph and film specific situations and send the images to the NGO they belong to. 

The app also has a web version, available for every citizen who wants to report on election irregularities. Monitorizare Vot was launched in 2016 and it has been used for the Romanian parliamentary elections so far, but it is available for further use, regardless of the type of elections or voting process.

### Deployment

#### Getting Started

**Step 1**. Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6 or newer installed on your
machine.

**Step 2**. Clone this repository or use [Yeoman
generator](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate/tree/generator-react-static) to
bootstrap your project:

```shell
$ git clone -o react-static-boilerplate -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies listed in package.json
```

<p align="center">——— or ———</p>

```shell
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g generator-react-static
$ mkdir MyApp
$ cd MyApp
$ yo react-static
```

**Step 3**. Compile and launch your app by running:

```shell
$ node run                      # Same as `npm start` or `node run start`
```

You can also test your app in release (production) mode by running `node run start --release` or
with HMR and React Hot Loader disabled by running `node run start --no-hmr`. The app should become
available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

#### How to Test

The unit tests are powered by [chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [mocha](http://mochajs.org/).

```shell
$ npm run lint                  # Check JavaScript and CSS code for potential issues
$ npm run test                  # Run unit tests. Or, `npm run test:watch`
```

#### How to Deploy

Update `publish` script in the [`run.js`](run.js) file with your full Firebase project name as found
in your [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Note that this may have an
additional identifier suffix than the shorter name you've provided. Then run: 

```shell
$ node run publish              # Build and publish the website to Firebase, same as `npm run publish`
```

The first time you publish, you will be prompted to authenticate with Google and generate an
authentication token in order for the publish script to continue.

If you need just to build the project without publishing it, run:

```shell
$ node run build                # Or, `node run build --release` for production build
```
